const aboutMe = `I've been into technology for as long as I can remember. It&apos;s always been more than just a hobby, it's something I live and breathe. I got into IT and programming pretty early, but it wasn&apos;t until high school that things really clicked for me. What started out as a way to get good grades turned into a genuine passion for learning and building things.
<br />
<br />
I started with JavaScript, and it&apos;s still my go-to language. Over time, I&apos;ve explored its entire ecosystem, always trying out new tools and frameworks, and spending most of my free time working on personal projects just for the fun of it.
<br />
<br />
When I was about 16, I got into Web3. Since I was too young for a regular job, I dove into freelancing instead. It turned out to be the best decisionâ€”I not only improved my technical skills but also learned how to work with clients and manage real-world projects.
<br />
<br />
Looking ahead to 2025, I&apos;ve set my sights on a few big goals: ace my final exams, get into the IT program at the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, and land a Junior Fullstack Developer role where I can keep learning, push my limits, and contribute to something meaningful.`;
